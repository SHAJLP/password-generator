# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

#Aim of Project

As an employee with access to sensitive data
I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
So that I can create a strong password that provides greater security

The project was to build code within HTML, CSS and JavaScript to randomly generate password/passcode.  These are used to provide security to a users sensitive data such as: addresses, date of birth, payment card details, etc.  The challenge set had specific criteria which included having a length of 8-128 characters, upper/lowercase,special characters and numerics. 

Once these prompts had been entered into the field, it would then allow user to generate the password/passcode, based on thier choices.
User can select wether or not they would like to include one or more characters, which generates a randomly generated password.
